Understand the Problem: Read and understand the challenge requirements, context, and evaluation criteria. Familiarize yourself with the provided dataset and the format of the labeled videos.

Data Exploration: Begin by exploring the labeled videos to get an understanding of the data. Analyze the structure and format of the labeled videos, including the 2D array describing the direction of travel at every frame.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the labeled videos to extract relevant information and prepare the data for further analysis. This may involve extracting frames from the videos, converting pixel coordinates to angles, and filtering out frames with a car speed of less than 4m/s.

Feature Engineering: Identify any additional features or information that may be useful for predicting the direction of travel in the unlabeled videos. This could include factors such as camera focal length, frame timestamps, or any other relevant metadata.

Model Selection: Select an appropriate model or algorithm to predict the direction of travel based on the labeled data. Since the dataset is small, it is advisable to avoid complex machine learning models. Instead, consider simpler approaches such as geometric transformations or rule-based methods.

Model Training: If applicable, train the selected model using the labeled videos. Adjust hyperparameters as necessary and perform any necessary cross-validation or regularization techniques.

Prediction: Apply the trained model to the unlabeled videos to generate the predicted labels. Use the extracted features and any relevant information to make accurate predictions.

Evaluation: Evaluate the predicted labels using the provided evaluation script or the mean squared error metric against the ground truth labels. Ensure that errors for frames with car speeds less than 4m/s are ignored, as specified in the evaluation criteria.

Refinement and Iteration: Analyze the performance of your model and iterate on the process to improve the predictions. Consider adjusting preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, or trying alternative models or algorithms.

Generate Final Labels: Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, generate the final labels for the unlabeled videos (5.txt to 9.txt) containing the pitch and yaw angles. Ensure the labels are in the correct format as specified in the challenge requirements.

Submission: Zip the generated labels and submit them via email to givemeajob@comma.ai as specified in the challenge instructions.
